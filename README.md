UNIT CONVERTOR APP
It's an Android application.
It can accept a given value as input, which has to be changed or converted into another unit.
Then you have to select the unit of the input value and then the output unit (in which the value has to be converted) from the drop-down list.
And finished!
The desired unit's value will now be shown to you.
